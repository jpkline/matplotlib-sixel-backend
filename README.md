# matplotlib-sixel-backend

This python module allows you to use your [sixel-enabled terminal](https://www.arewesixelyet.com/) to show inline plots generated by python's [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). It is optimized for use with [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) on Windows 11, but may work on other systems.

Install with

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/jpkline/matplotlib-sixel-backend.git
```

Use by either setting the environment variable `MPLBACKEND` to `module://matplotlib-sixel-backend` or by initializing matplotlib as in the example below

```python
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

matplotlib.use("module://matplotlib-sixel-backend")

plt.style.use("dark_background")

t = np.linspace(0, 5, 200)
plt.fill_between(t, np.sin(t), np.cos(2 * t), alpha=0.5)
plt.fill_between(t, np.cos(t), np.sin(2 * t), alpha=0.5)

plt.show()
```
